<h3 id="what">1.1. What is MaxFEM?</h3>
<p>MaxFEM is a free software package for numerical simulation in electromagnetism covering electrostatics, direct current, magnetostatics and eddy currents. In addition to the code itself, MaxFEM also includes a user interface to facilitate its handling. Especially important is the reconfigurable nature of it, which easily adapts to the numerical solution of other physical and mathematical problems.</p>

<p>MaxFEM is fitted with an effective help manual. The manual consists of a set of independent sections where the different modules composing the package are described. In particular, the equations modeling each electromagnetic phenomenon are introduced and some examples illustrating different applications are explained.</p>

<p>This structure reflects the modular architecture of the software where new features can be implemented without any changes in the main program connecting all the modules.</p>

<h3 id="requirement">1.3. Requirements and installation</h3>
<p>MaxFEM requires <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3</a> with packages <a href="https://pypi.org/project/wxPython/">wxPython</a>>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/vtk/">vtk</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/paramiko/">paramiko</a>".</p>

<p>We recommend to install MaxFEM from binaries. Please visit <a href="../../README.md">README.md</a> for more detailed information.</p>

<h3 id="typographical">1.7. Typographical convention</h3>
<p>The following typographical
conventions will be used throughout this help manual:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>A <strong>bold</strong> font indicates that the given word(s) appear exactly in that way on the graphical user interface. For instance, we often refer to <strong>Project</strong>, which is the menu that appears in the left upper part of the graphical interface.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>An arrow <strong>&#8594;</strong> indicates a sequence of steps in the menu items to achieve a particular task. For example, the sequence <strong>Project &#8594; Applications &#8594; Electrostatics 2D</strong> is equivalent to select the <strong>Project</strong> menu, display the <strong>Application</strong> submenu and choose the item label <strong>Electrostatic 2D</strong>.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>An <strong class="gris">italic bold font</strong> refers to labels and buttons in the dialog boxes appearing on the graphical user interface. For example, the sequence <strong>Visualization &#8594; Mesh &#8594;</strong> <strong class="gris">Choose representation</strong>, implies that when you display the <strong>Visualization</strong> menu and select the <strong>Mesh</strong> submenu, the label <strong class="gris">Choose representation</strong> indicates that the user must choose one on the options given below for the representation of the mesh.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>An <i>italic font</i> indicates keyboard entries in the user interface.</p></li>
  <li><p>A <strong><font color="blue">blue font</font></strong> indicates a link.</p></li>
</ul>
