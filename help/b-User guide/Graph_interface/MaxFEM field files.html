<p>All the MaxFEM solvers write the resulting fields in the working folder using the VTK XML format, developed by 
<a href="http://www.kitware.com/">Kitware Inc</a>. The file type is serial and the mesh is considered an unstructured grid. Thus, 
the corresponding extension for the result files is VTU. The VTK format is described <a href="http://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf">here</a>.

<p>MaxFEM solvers use a <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/stefanozaghi/lib_vtk_io">Fortran 90 module</a> to write VTK XML. 
The main portion of this code has been programmed by Stefano Zaghi (Dept. of Computational Hydrodynamics at INSEAN).</p>
 
<p>MaxFEM automatically loads the result files. If the user wants to manage and/or visualize the results by its own, a wide range of 
graphic applications support VTK XML files, like <a href="http://www.paraview.org/">Paraview</a>, <a href="http://mayavi.sourceforge.net/">MayaVi</a>, 
<a href="http://www.ensight.com/">EnSight</a>,... For each result field, the name of the VTU file can be seen by clicking <strong class="gris">Names</strong> button in the <a href="Introduction.html#interface">Visualization menu</a>.</p>

<h4>Data fields</h4>
<p>In some applications, a data field must be provided by the user. That is the case, for example, when a temperature field is necessary 
to work with materials with properties that depend on temperature. In such case, VTK XML is a valid format for those
data files.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the user can provide a file in MFF format. The files written in this simple format are ASCII files composed
of a single record. This record contains an integer <var>nver</var> and a double precision array <var>v</var>, with all the 
elements separated by blank spaces:
<ul>
  <li><p><var>nver</var> is the number of nodes of the mesh multiplied by the dimension of the field (a scalar field has dimension 1).</p></li>
  <li><p><var>v</var> is the array formed by the field values on the nodes. In the case of a vector field, all the coordinates
  of the field in each node appear consecutive in <var>v</var>.</p></li>
</ul>
