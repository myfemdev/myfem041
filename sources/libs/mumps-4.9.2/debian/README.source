This package uses quilt to manage all modifications to the upstream
source.  Changes are stored in the source package as diffs in
debian/patches and applied during the build.

See /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source for a detailed explanation.

The upstream doc directory contains only non-free files and is removed
for this DFSG version.
